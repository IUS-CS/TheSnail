#Project Reflections
Thomas:  
More discussion and research in the beginning could have saved us time with the GUI we ended up picking the first GUI that worked the outdated JFrame. Instead of using the newer JavaFx. More work should have been put into the beginning of the project making sure the code did not have so much redundancy and was cleaner to read.

#Calvinâ€™s reflections:

My roll in the project was creating the radio buttons and create a scroll bar for underlying text. The one thing I found out is that JFrame is harder than it looks to work with. The JFrame gave me so many problems that I thought JavaFx would have been so much better.I think we all could have had a little more input on the thought of what the overall project should have appeared to look like from the beginning. The way in which the html output was formed was a little out of the unordinary way in which I have used html. If we had to do it all over again, I would have  definitely recommended that we would have just built a website instead of just a web application; Although this web application has a lot of potential to be improved.

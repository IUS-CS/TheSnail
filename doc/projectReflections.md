#Project Reflections
Thomas:  
More discussion and research in the beginning could have saved us time with the GUI we ended up picking the first GUI that worked the outdated JFrame. Instead of using the newer JavaFx. More work should have been put into the beginning of the project making sure the code did not have so much redundancy and was cleaner to read.

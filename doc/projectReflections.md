# Project Reflections
Thomas:  
More discussion and research in the beginning could have saved us time with the GUI we ended up picking the first GUI that worked the outdated JFrame. Instead of using the newer JavaFx. More work should have been put into the beginning of the project making sure the code did not have so much redundancy and was cleaner to read.

Greg:  
More Internal Work Could have been done, Communication was an issue with myself throughout the semester. Issues were experienced while learning to use GitHub and various elements of Git. Coding the whole project with external style sheets would have made the project a bit easier to handle however inline styles were a little harder to test for string printing. Alot or prior research might of helped eliminate issues with coding and Jframe and JavaFX Coding. 

Calvin:
My roll in the project was creating the radio buttons and create a scroll bar for underlying text. The one thing I found out is that JFrame is harder than it looks to work with. The JFrame gave me so many problems that I thought JavaFx would have been so much better.I think we all could have had a little more input on the thought of what the overall project should have appeared to look like from the beginning. The way in which the html output was formed was a little out of the unordinary way in which I have used html. If we had to do it all over again, I would have  definitely recommended that we would have just built a website instead of just a web application; Although this web application has a lot of potential to be improved. 

Hannah:
We definitely didn't do enough research at the beginning of the project. Using JFrame as a quick fix at the start caused us a lot of issues later on. My main contribution to the project was coding the math functions, including creating varying levels of difficulty. I think our group would have benefited from communicating more from the start. We all had different ideas of what our project would be and not everyone was in agreement on choices that were made at the start.

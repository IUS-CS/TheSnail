Thomas:  
More discussion and research in the beginning could have saved us time with the GUI we ended up picking the first GUI that worked the outdated JFrame. Instead of using the newer JavaFx. More work should have been put into the beginning of the project making sure the code did not have so much redundancy and was cleaner to read.

More Internal Work Could have been done, Communication was an issue with myself throughout the semester. Issues were experienced while learning to use GitHub and various elements of Git. Coding the whole project with external style sheets would have made the project a bit easier to handle however inline styles were a little harder to test for string printing. Alot or prior research might of helped eliminate issues with coding and Jframe and JavaFX Coding.
